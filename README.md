# Census of India

Introduction to Project :-<br>
•	This project was made as a part of summer institutional training in Chandigarh University.<br>
•	We were assigned the topic of Census of India to do as our project.<br>
•	It was really a very interesting topic as while making the project we had gone through many ups and downs while completing the project.<br>
•	The project starts form the webpage in which you’ll see the logo of of Indian Government just at the right hand side it’s written as <br>
Office of the Registrar General & Census Commissioner, India<br>
Government of India<br>
and just righthand side of that is given the links for various social networking sites of Census of India like of Facebook, Twitter and Youtube.<br>
•	Below all these, navigation menu is provided with various options like Home, About Us, Census Organisation, Submit Your Form, Acts and Rules, Current Population of World, Contact Us, Meet the Developers and many more.<br>
•	About Us section contains all the information related to Census of India.<br>
•	Census Organisation section contains the details about the working body of Indian Census.<br>
•	Acts and Rules section contains all the acts and rules(laws) made for the proper conduct of Census of India. It also includes various PDFs related to the same which one can download on his/her PC.<br>
•	Current Population of World contains the population of the world which always keep on increasing as time increases.<br>
•	Contact Us section provides the contact details of the official bodies of the Census of India.<br>
•	Meet the developers section contains all the details of us, i.e. the one who made the project.<br>
•	Submit your form is the section in which one who wish to submit his/her details along with the family member details can do so and all the details will be saved in the database.<br>
•The whole project works with great efficiency, and below are the Software Requirements and specifications of this project.<br>

Tools & Technology Used :-

•	HTML :- Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web.<br>
•	CSS :- Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.<br>
•	JavasScript :- JavaScript(often shortened to JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class functions, and is best known as the scripting language for Web pages, but it's used in many non-browser environments as well. It is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm scripting language that is dynamic, and supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.<br>
•	SQL :- Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS). It is particularly useful in handling structured data where there are relations between different entities/variables of the data. <br>
•	Brackets :- Brackets is an open-source editor written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a primary focus on web development. It was created by Adobe Systems, licensed under the MIT License, and is currently maintained on GitHub by Adobe and other open-sourced developers. Brackets is available for cross-platform download on Mac, Windows, and is compatible with most linux distros. The main purpose of brackets is it's live html, css and js editing functionality.<br>
•	Notepad ++ :- Notepad++ is a text editor and source code editor for use with Microsoft Windows. It supports tabbed editing, which allows working with multiple open files in a single window. The project's name comes from the C increment operator.<br>
•	Google Chrome :- Google Chrome is a freeware web browser developed by Google. It was first released in September 2008, for Microsoft Windows, and was later portedto Linux, macOS, iOS and Android. Google Chrome is also the main component of Chrome OS, where it serves as a platform for running web apps.<br>
•	XAMPP :- XAMPP is a free and open source cross-platform web server solution stack package developed by Apache Friends, consisting mainly of the Apache HTTP Server, MariaDB database, and interpreters for scripts written in the PHP and Perl programming languages. XAMPP stands for Cross-Platform (X), Apache (A), MariaDB (M), PHP (P) and Perl (P).<br>


Results and Discussion :-
•	We, Saket Karn & Akash Ranjan, students of Chandigarh University were given a project on Web Development as our Summer Training.<br>
•	The project was to design a working website on Census of India.<br>
•	It included some webpages related to Indian Census and we had to take the entry from the user and store them in the database.<br>
•	This project was not an easy task as while making the project many critical situations came like pictures were not perfectly aligned, borders were not coming as required, CSS sometimes was not working and we had to recheck it again and again as HTML is a really funny language as even a ‘,’ missed can put the whole webpage look like nothing even if you have written each and everything almost correct.<br>
•	Frontend — this is what the end user see’s and interacts with on the page. Its all the design, fancy effects, layout and imagery that creates the user experience.<br>
•	Generally front end developers will be visual creatives with excellent design skills and a passion for accessibility and user experience. Technologies often associated with front end web development are HTML, CSS, jQuery and JavaScript.<br>
•	Backend — this is the part that typically processes, stores, and manipulates data. It’s how the website or application works. Back-end developers are generally good problem solvers, logical thinkers who are interested in the functionality of a website or application. Back-end development is usually associated with server side languages such as PHP, Python, and Ruby.<br>
•	According to me: you don’t in any way need to be a HTML and CSS expert before you can start building things, or moving on to learning a server side language. 0.<br>
•	You don’t have to spend months and months doing tutorial after tutorial. Once you have the fundamentals down, you can learn as you build.<br>

Conclusion and Future Scope :-
•	Doing this project was a real fun as well as thrilling task. This project helped us to make a website and how to fetch and insert details to and from website to database which will really be very helpful for us in our future. It really taught us so many things which we can’t count on our fingers. We would like to thank our teachers for guiding us all the time and the University for providing an opportunity to learn these so much interesting things which we will never be able to forget even if we try to.<br>
•	With new technologies and movements constantly arriving on the scene, our sense of where things are going is more uncertain than ever. And so we wanted to investigate what the landscape of web design might look like in another 20 years or so.<br>
•	As we move towards the mid-21st century, it's indisputable that web design is going to become increasingly important. As people live more and more of their lives online, digital user experiences will be the rock on which almost every big organisation is built. But there's one slight problem."There's a demand for good software but broadly speaking, there aren't enough good developers to build those things," says Craig Frost, designer at Pusher. "And even if there were, infrastructure is something that takes lots and lots of time and attention – time that could be better spent on building features for customers."<br>
•	But here's the good news: to plug that gap, we're currently seeing an explosion in developer tools.<br>
•	Pusher's tools, for example, make it easy to build real-time features into applications, so they update automatically without users having to refresh the browser.<br>
•	Building websites used to be slow, expensive, and hard to maintain. And it also meant you had to have a lot of skills, a lot of people. Now we're putting the power back into the product builders' hands. Which means you can spend less time maintaining these applications, more on customer needs. Having conversations with them, building things they need." And how should we discover what users need? Funnily enough, that's something that's changing too…<br>
•	Because of the new popularity of UI animation, it is creating a new demand for skilled practitioners. "You can now specialize in animation on the web, and it's becoming more recognised as an art in itself. We live in a digital world where people scroll through 300ft of content a day, so the more and more we progress in technology, the more this is going to keep escalating.<br>
